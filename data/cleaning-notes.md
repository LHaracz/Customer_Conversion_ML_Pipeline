# Data Cleaning Summary

The raw dataset required minimal preprocessing.

Key steps included:
- Validation that no duplicate rows or missing values were present
- Creation of dummy variables for relevant categorical columns
- Removal of non-predictive operational columns
- Preservation of all behavioral and demographic features
- No row-level filtering was required

This ensured model performance improvements were driven by algorithmic choice
rather than heavy data manipulation.
